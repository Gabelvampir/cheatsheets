<h1>A very brief guide to Linux</h1>
<p><a href="http://www.physics.usyd.edu.au/~rennie/">C. J. Rennie</a></p>
<p>5th April 2011</p>
</div>
<hr>

<p>This document is for those who are just beginning with Linux.  It covers
the really essential commands in some detail, but also gives some impression
of the great scope of commands that are available.  It says nothing about 
email clients, browsers, compilers etc, which are either documented elsewhere
or are sufficiently GUI not to need any documentation such as this.</p>

<!-- ================================================================== -->
<h2><a name="starting">Logging in and out</a></h2>
<p>You always need to log in by specifying your user name and your password.  
Once that is done, the Desktop Environment (usually 'Gnome' or 'KDE') starts, 
and you will be able to do things like open terminal windows, run the file 
manager, or browse the Internet.</p>

<p>Log off via the menu options provided by the desktop.</p>

<p>To try out the things described in this document it will help to
have a 'terminal' window open.  How to do this should be obvious from
whatever desktop you are using.</p>

<!-- ================================================================== -->
<h2><a name="directories">Directories</a></h2>
<p>Whatever computing background you have, you will be familiar with
the concept of directories (or 'folders'), which are arranged hierarchically,
and act as containers for files.</p>

<p>There are between 5 and 10 thousand directories on a Linux machine,
so it is good to have some idea of how they are organized.  The directory
tree consists of branches having certain functions.   The details differ
on the various Linux versions, but top level or 'root' directory is
always designated '<code>/</code>', and contains the following directories</p>
<table class="general" title="Major Linux directories">
<tbody><tr><th>Path</th>  <th>Function</th></tr>
<tr><td><code>/suphys/<em>your_name</em>/</code></td>
            <td>For the personal use of users</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>/media/</code></td>  
            <td>CD-ROMs, floppies, data directories on other machines</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>/usr/</code></td>  <td>Where most programs are located</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>/bin/</code></td>  <td>Core operating system programs</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>/sbin/</code></td> <td>Core operating system programs</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>/etc/</code></td>  
            <td>Configuration files for operating system</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>amongst others.</p>

<p>The branches are sorted here according to relevance for everyday work, 
so concern yourself with the first couple do not try to mess with those 
near the bottom.  (You will be prevented anyway.)</p>

<p>You are free to create directories under your home directory and
certain other areas (e.g., under <code>/media/floppy</code>), while
others area may be protected against modifications.  When creating a
directory (or file), the names are case-sensitive and you can use
spaces  however spaces are often confusing and annoying (they have
to be quoted), and I advise against the practice.</p>

<p>You can access directories by specifying their name explicitly (i.e.,
by giving some path beginning with '<code>/</code>', for example
<code>/suphys/chris</code>), or by using shortcuts.  The shortcuts are as
follows: '<code>.</code>' means the current directory; '<code>..</code>' 
means the next directory up; '<code>~</code>' means your home directory.  
Thus '<code>~/data</code>' refers to one of your own directories, 
'<code>data</code>', located under your home directory.</p>

<p>Another great help is auto-completion.  If you are part-way through
typing a path, then pressing the <span class="modifier">Tab</span> key
will complete the directory or filename.  If there is ambiguity in how
to complete the name, then <span class="modifier">Tab</span> will just
fill in as much as it can, whereupon you can enter another character or two
to resolve the ambiguity and press <span class="modifier">Tab</span> again.
Repeat as often as necessary.  If you are unsure how to resolve the
ambiguity, you can press <span class="modifier">Ctrl-D</span> at any time
to see what the alternatives are.</p>

<p>If the full path of some directory or file is printed somewhere on
screen, a common trick for using this name in a command is to cut and
paste: highlight the block with left-click and drag; paste it with
middle-click.  (This is the Linux equivalent of
<span class="modifier">Ctrl-C</span> and
<span class="modifier">Ctrl-V</span>.)  Another way to highlight is
by multiple clicks.</p>

<p>Navigating directories on the command line is not as intuitive as with
a graphical browser, but can still be done, and done surprisingly
efficiently.</p>


<!-- ================================================================== -->
<h2><a name="essential">Essential commands</a></h2>
<p>This section gives brief, illustrated descriptions of a few really
essential commands.  They are basic command for dealing with directories
and files.</p>

<p>Change you current directory with <code>cd</code>:</p>
<table class="optCmd">
<tbody><tr><td class="optCmd">cd ..</td>
    <td>change to the next directory up</td></tr>
<tr><td class="optCmd">cd /usr/bin</td>
    <td>Change to the directory <code>/usr/bin</code></td></tr>
<tr><td class="optCmd">cd ~</td>
     <td>Change to your home directory</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>Listing the contents of directories is done with <code>ls</code>:</p>
<table class="optCmd">
<tbody><tr><td class="optCmd">ls</td>
    <td>Compact listing of the current directory </td></tr>
<tr><td class="optCmd">ls -l /usr/bin</td>
    <td>Detailed listing of <code>/usr/bin</code></td></tr>
<tr><td class="optCmd">ls ~</td>
    <td>Compact listing of your home directory</td></tr>
<tr><td class="optCmd">ls -la ~</td>
    <td>Detailed listing of your home directory, including those the
    semi-hidden files beginning with '.'</td></tr>
<tr><td class="optCmd">ls -lt</td>
    <td>Detailed listing of the current directory, in chronological 
    order</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>Copying is done with <code>cp</code>:</p>
<table class="optCmd">
<tbody><tr><td class="optCmd">cp <em>filename</em> <em>dir</em></td>
    <td>Copy a file to some other directory, resulting in 
    <em>dir/filename</em></td></tr>
<tr><td class="optCmd">cp <em>filename</em> <em>newname</em></td>
    <td>Make a copy, named <code>newname</code>, of the specified file</td></tr>
<tr><td class="optCmd">cp <em>something*</em> <em>dir</em></td>
    <td>Copy all files with names matching <code><em>something*</em></code> to 
    the directory <code><em>dir</em></code></td></tr>
<tr><td class="optCmd">cp -r <em>dir1</em> <em>dir2</em></td>
    <td>Copy all files and subdirectories in <code><em>dir1</em></code> to a 
    new directory <code><em>dir2/dir1</em></code></td></tr>
<tr><td class="optCmd">cp -r <em>dir1/*</em> <em>dir2</em></td>
    <td>Copy all files and subdirectories in <code><em>dir1</em></code> into the
    existing directory <code><em>dir2</em></code></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p style="margin-left:50px">Note the subtle but important difference between 
copying from <code><em>dir1</em></code> and from <code><em>dir1/*</em></code>.
</p>

<p>Moving and/or renaming is done with <code>mv</code>:</p>
<table class="optCmd">
<tbody><tr><td class="optCmd">mv <em>filename</em> <em>dir</em></td>
    <td>Move a file to some directory <code><em>dir</em></code></td></tr>
<tr><td class="optCmd">mv <em>something*</em> <em>dir</em></td>
    <td>Moves all files with names matching <code><em>something*</em></code> 
    to the directory <code><em>dir</em></code></td></tr>
<tr><td class="optCmd">mv -r <em>dir1</em> <em>dir2</em></td>
    <td>Move all files and subdirectories in <code><em>dir1</em></code> to a 
    new directory <code><em>dir2/dir1</em></code></td></tr>
<tr><td class="optCmd">mv -r <em>dir1/*</em> <em>dir2</em></td>
    <td>Move all files and subdirectories in <code><em>dir1</em></code> into 
    the existing directory <code><em>dir2</em></code></td></tr>
<tr><td class="optCmd">mv <em>filename</em> <em>newname</em></td>
    <td>Rename a file or directory</td></tr>
<tr><td class="optCmd">mv <em>filename</em> <em>dir/newname</em></td>
    <td>Move a file to some directory <code><em>dir</em></code> and rename 
    it</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p style="margin-left:50px">When moving and copying with <code>mv</code> and 
<code>cp</code>, the target directory <em>must</em> already exist.</p>

<p>Use <code>mkdir</code> and <code>rmdir</code> to create and remove 
directories:</p>
<table class="optCmd">
<tbody><tr><td class="optCmd">mkdir Aug21</td>
    <td>Make a new directory within the current directory</td></tr>
<tr><td class="optCmd">mkdir ~/data/Aug21</td>
    <td>Make a new directory (<code>Aug21</code> in this case) in 
    <code>~/data</code></td></tr>
<tr><td class="optCmd">rmdir ~/data/Aug21</td>
    <td>Remove a directory (<code>Aug21</code> in this case) from 
    <code>~/data</code></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p style="margin-left:50px">But note that Linux prevents you (as a 
precaution against lapses of judgment) from deleting directories that 
still contain files.  This can be a lifesaver: bit it can also be a 
chore to delete all files before being allowed to issue the <code>rmdir</code> 
command.  However I expect that you will eventually discover the way 
around this default behaviour, which will enable you to delete a directory 
and all its contents (including subdirectories) with a single command.</p>

<p>Removing files is done with <code>rm</code>:</p>
<table class="optCmd">
<tbody><tr><td class="optCmd">rm <em>filename</em></td>
    <td>Delete a particular file from the current directory</td></tr>
<tr><td class="optCmd">rm <code><em>dir/filename*</em></code></td>
    <td>Delete files matching the pattern <code><em>filename*</em></code> 
     from the directory <code><em>dir</em></code></td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>The commands described above are just the start.  You will find that
each command has many, many options  and the way to learn about the
other options is to consult the 'man' pages:</p>
<table class="optCmd">
<tbody><tr><td class="optCmd">man -k PDF</td>
    <td>Lists all commands connected in any way to PDF</td></tr>
<tr><td class="optCmd">man ls</td>
    <td>Tells you <em>everything</em> about <code>ls</code></td></tr>
<tr><td class="optCmd">man rm</td>
    <td>Tells you <em>everything</em> about <code>rm</code></td></tr>
<tr><td class="optCmd">etc</td>
    <td>etc</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>With hundreds of commands available <code>man</code> might seem of 
little use to neophytes.  The <code>man -k <em>keyword</em></code> option is 
one way to find out what is available; others are the thematic lists in
<a href="#common">Some common commands</a>, and the excellent
<em>Linux in a Nutshell</em>.</p>
 
<p>It is also useful to know about <em>redirection</em>.  Output is commonly
listed on the terminal, but can be redirected to a file with the
'<code>&gt;</code>' command.  Thus
</p><pre class="screen">  ls -1 ~/data &gt; names.txt
</pre>
<p>stores the output as a file named <code>names.txt</code>, overwriting the
pre-existing file of this name, if any.  (A variation of this output
redirection command is '<code>&gt;&gt;</code>', which
<em>appends</em> the output to an existing file, rather than overwriting.)
The opposite is '&lt;', which gets input from a file rather than the
keyboard, e.g.
</p><pre class="screen">  mail -s 'Hi' &lt; letter.txt
</pre>

<p>Programs can be run in the 'background' by appending an ampersand
('&amp;') to the command line.  Thus
</p><pre class="screen">  gv doc.ps &amp;
</pre>
<p>launches ghostview and puts it in the background.  What does 'background'
mean, and why would you want to do this?  Without the ampersand the program
runs in the foreground, which means that no new commands can be entered on
the command line.  Launching the program in the background allows new
commands to be entered on the command line.  <em>The program operates
identically in both cases.</em></p>

<p>There are thousands of commands documented in the man pages.  If you
want to see for yourself, type
</p><pre class="screen">  find /usr/share -name 'man' -type d | xargs ls -lR
</pre>
<p>which also gives you a taste of the sophisticated way in which all
those commands can be used.  In this example, <code>find</code> is used to
look for all directories named '<code>man</code>' in the directory
<code>/usr/share</code>,
including all its subdirectories.  That produces a list of directories
that contain <code>man</code> pages.  The list is not printed: instead it is
'piped' to the <code>xargs</code> command, which constructs commands like
<code>ls -lR <em>dirname</em></code>, each of which generates a recursive
directory listing of all files in the man directory, and its
subdirectories.  The upshot is that the compound command above locates
and lists all man pages, however scattered they are in the
<code>/usr/share</code> branch of the directory tree.  You can augment the 
above command slightly:
</p><pre class="screen">  find /usr/share -name 'man' -type d | xargs ls -lR | wc -l
</pre>
<p>to get an approximate count of the number of man pages.  But even this is 
a rather elementary example of the power of Unix/Linux commands.</p>

<!-- ================================================================== -->
<h2><a name="#common">Some common commands</a></h2>
<p>Here are some more useful commands.  They are a tiny fraction of the 
command-line programs available, but give a taste of what can be 
accomplished.  Most of the commands below are core Linux utilities.  See 
the 'man' pages for more about their purpose, and more about their
options  wherein lies their real power.  Also listed below
are several large applications, which tend to have built-in instructions.</p>

<p>If you are a newcomer to Linux you may not understand the point of the
commands listed below, or doubt their value.  All I can say is that I
have used them all, and consider each one useful or even invaluable.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: Linux is astonishingly diverse in its manifestations,
and is evolving rapidly.  Consequently you may find that as many as 5 to 10% of
the above commands are unavailable on your system.  The common commands
are quite stable, however.</p>


<!-- ================================================================== -->
<h2><a name="examples">Some examples</a></h2>
<p>Some of the commands in <a href="#common">Some common commands</a> are so
common and useful that they deserve a few more comments.</p>

<h3><code>gzip</code> and <code>gunzip</code></h3>
<p>These are used for compressing and uncompressing files.  Typically you
will have a file, for example <code>Study0223.tar</code>, that you want to 
compress before FTP'ing it to some other site.  You just need to enter
</p><pre class="screen">    gzip Study0223.tar
</pre>
<p>and the original file will be replaced by one named 
<code>Study0223.tar.gz</code>.   Conversely, if you receive a file with 
the tell-tale extension <code>.gz</code> then entering
</p><pre class="screen">    gunzip Study0223.tar.gz
</pre>
<p>will expand the file to one named <code>Study0223.tar</code>.  The 
uncompression command <code>gunzip</code> is especially useful since it 
can deal with several compression formats: <code>gzip</code>, <code>zip</code>,
<code>compress</code>, and <code>pack</code>.  The detection of the input 
format is automatic.</p>

<h3><code>tar</code></h3>
<p>The name <code>tar</code> comes from Tape ARchive, but is more commonly
used to bundle a group of files and write it to another file, rather 
than to a tape.  A simple example would be:</p><pre class="screen">    tar cvf <em>tarfile.tar file1.eeg file2.eeg ...</em>
</pre>

<p>This takes any number of files <code><em>file1.eeg file2.eeg ...</em></code>,
specified explicitly or using wildcard characters ('<code>*</code>', 
'<code>?</code>' etc), and bundles them into an output file 
<code>tarfile.tar</code>.  The options are: <code>c</code> to create an 
archive, <code>v</code> to do so verbosely, and <code>f</code> to output 
to a file with the immediately following name.   (The <code>v</code> is 
optional, but can be reassuring.)</p>

<p>It is probably more common (and more powerful) to specify a
<em>directory</em> instead of a list of input files, as in:
</p><pre class="screen">    tar cvf /media/usb/backup.chris.jan.tar /suphys/chris
</pre>
<p>which is what I might do to back up my home directory, including all
subdirectories.  A warning though: it is both illogical and
<em>bad</em> to <code>tar</code> a directory and write the output file to
that same directory!</p>

<p>If you receive a tar file, say <code>somefile.tar</code>, then I suggest
you first look at its contents by</p><pre class="screen">    tar tf somefile.tar
</pre>
<p>This will produce a list of the enclosed files, including any
subdirectories.  When you untar the file, the listed files 
including subdirectories  can be created in the current directory,
and this might not be what you want.  It is advisable to use the <code>t</code>
option to anticipate exactly what will
happen when you extract the contents of the tar file.  Perhaps you 
should move the tar file into a suitably-named subdirectory before
extracting its contents.  What you <em>don't</em> want to do is extract
lots of files, and then find that they are hopelessly mixed up with
pre-existing files</p>

<p>When you are satisfied that the tar file is in an appropriate
location, you can extract everything with</p><pre class="screen">    tar xvf somefile.tar
</pre>
<p>where <code>x</code> means extract, and <code>v</code> and <code>f</code> 
have the usual meanings.  Users will occasionally wish to extract a specific
file or files: that is easily achieved by appending the names of the
required files, as in</p><pre class="screen">    tar xvf somefile.tar go-nogo/10038259/slice5.dcm
</pre>
<p>The requested file '<code>slice5.dcm</code>' will then be created in a
subdirectory '<code>go-nogo/10038259/</code>' under the current directory.</p>

<h3><code>find</code></h3>
<p>While the command <code>locate</code> may be adequate much of the time for 
tracking down files, the command <code>find</code> is far more powerful.  
The basic usage is <code>find <em>directory criterion</em></code>.  
It searches in directory <code><em>directory</em></code>, and all 
subdirectories, for anything matching <code><em>criterion</em></code>.  
Thus you could enter
</p><pre class="screen">    find ~/docs -name thesis.doc
</pre> 
<p>to look for <code>thesis.doc</code> among your personal documents, or
</p><pre class="screen">    find ~ -name 'note*'
</pre>
<p>to find files with names matching <code>note*</code>.  (Note that the 
quotes are <em>essential</em> when using wildcard characters with 
<code>find</code>.)</p>

<p>You can search for particular directory names, as well as 
file names.  If you wish to be specific, you could expand the
criterion by appending <code>-type d</code> or <code>-type f</code>.</p>

<p>The criteria can go far beyond the simple cases above.  Here are
a few more examples:
</p><table class="general">
<tbody><tr><td><code>find ~ -atime -4</code></td>
    <td>All files under <code>~</code> accessed in last 4 days</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>find ~ -mtime -4</code></td>
    <td>All files under <code>~</code> modified in last 4 days</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>find / -user chris</code></td>
    <td>List all files owned by <code>chris</code></td></tr>
<tr><td><code>find ~ -name 'core.*' -exec rm {} \;</code></td>
    <td>Delete all core dumps</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>The <code>find</code> command is even more powerful in combination with
others.  A very common example is this: you want to identify a subset of
files (<code>*.tex</code>) within some directory (<code>~/docs</code>) and all
subdirectories; and to search within this subset of files for a particular
string of characters ('needle').  The way to do this is:
</p><pre class="screen">    find ~/docs -name '*.tex' | xargs grep -n 'needle'
</pre>
<p>The output shows, for each match, the file, line number and the line itself.
</p>

<p>The following shows progressive elaboration of a <code>find</code>, which 
ultimately performs a selective archive of all recently modified files.
</p><table class="general">
<tbody><tr><td><pre>find ./progs ./tex -ctime -75 -type f</pre></td>
    <td>All files under <code>./progs</code> and <code>./tex</code> that have 
    been created, modified, or had their status changed in the last 75 
    days</td></tr>
<tr><td><pre>find ./progs ./tex -ctime -75 -type f \
     -o -path ./progs/corejsf -prune  \
     -o -path ./progs/jeda/build -prune</pre></td>
    <td>Ditto, but exclude two subdirectories</td></tr>
<tr><td><pre>find ./progs ./tex -ctime -75 -type f \
     -o -path ./progs/corejsf -prune  \
     -o -path ./progs/jeda/build -prune \
     | xargs tar cvf backup.tar
    </pre></td>
    <td>Ditto, but additionally bundle the files as <code>backup.tar</code>
    </td></tr>
</tbody></table>


<h3><code>make</code></h3>
<p>It is very common to use the <code>make</code> utility when compiling
programs, although <code>make</code> can be used for doing all sorts of
operations.  This utility looks for a file, conventionally named
<code>Makefile</code>, and performs any one of several sets of commands.</p>

<p>An example <code>Makefile</code> is as follows:
</p><pre class="screen">    PROG    =eegfit
    CC      =gcc
    
    # For profiling support add -pg, for which -g3 is a prerequisite
    CFLAGS_G        = -Wall
    CFLAGS_D        = -g3 -ggdb
    CFLAGS_R        = -O 
    CFLAGS  =$(CFLAGS_G) $(CFLAGS_D)
    
    # For profiling support add -pg
    LFLAGS_G        = -lX11 -lm -lncurses -L/usr/X11R6/lib
    LFLAGS_D        = 
    LFLAGS_R        = 
    LFLAGS  =$(LFLAGS_G) $(LFLAGS_D)
    
    SOURCES = eegfit.c spectfit.c xlib.c gammq.c \
              gser.c gcf.c gammln.c ran1.c gasdev.c
    OBJECTS = eegfit.o spectfit.o xlib.o gammq.o \
              gser.o gcf.o gammln.o ran1.o gasdev.o
    
    %.o: %.c
            $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c $&lt;
    
    eegfit: $(OBJECTS)
            $(CC) -o $@ $(OBJECTS) $(LFLAGS)
    
    clean:
            rm -f *.o $(PROG)
    
    all:
            $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c $(SOURCES)
            $(MAKE)
    
    tar:
            tar -cvf eegfit.tar $(SOURCES) *.h makefile
    
    # Dependencies
    eegfit.o:       parameter.h
    spectfit.o:     parameter.h xlib.h
    xlib.o:         xlib.h
</pre>

<p>This example makefile specifies all the files involved in a program,
<code>eegfit</code>, and all the operations required to achieve certain ends:
compilation, starting afresh, and creating a tar archive.  Having created
this makefile, it is then just a matter of typing one of the following:<br>
</p><table class="general">
<tbody><tr><td><code>make eegfit</code></td>
    <td>Compile the application</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>make</code></td>
    <td>Ditto</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>make clean</code></td>
    <td>Delete the object files and the executable</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>make tar</code></td>
    <td>Bundle all source files into <code>eegfit.tar</code></td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<!-- ================================================================== -->
<h2><a name="environment">Environment</a></h2>
<p>The key to convenient program execution is understanding your
<code>$PATH</code>.  This is an 'environment' variable: it can be
examined by typing <code>echo $PATH</code>, and it lists all directories
that are searched automatically whenever you try to run a program.  If
a program with the name you specify is found in any of the directories
listed in <code>$PATH</code>, then it is run  otherwise you get a
message <code>Command not found</code>.</p>

<p>As an example of displaying the <code>$PATH</code>:
</p><pre class="screen">    echo $PATH
    /bin:/usr/bin:/usr/bin/X11:/usr/local/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin:.
</pre>

<p>The presence of '<code>/bin</code>' is the reason you can type 
<code>vi</code> instead of having to type the full, explicit path 
<code>/bin/vi</code>, whenever you want to edit a file.  For the same 
reason the '<code>.</code>' at the end means that programs in your current 
directory can be run without any directory prefix.</p>

<p>You are free to alter the <code>$PATH</code> variable, and the best way
to do so is in your <code>.cshrc</code> file.  This is a configuration
file for your command interpreter or 'shell', and can be viewed by
<code>less ~/.cshrc</code>.  You will generally see in it references to
<code>setenv</code> and much else besides.  If you want to prepend some
directory to your <code>$PATH</code> (your personal program directory
<code>~/bin</code>, say) then type either of
</p><pre class="screen">    setenv PATH ~/bin:$PATH
    set path=(~/bin $path)
</pre>
<p>(both do the same thing), and from then on you will be able to run your
program <code>~/bin/model</code> (say) just by typing <code>model</code>,
irrespective of your current directory.</p>

<p>Actually it is better to place the above line in your <code>.cshrc</code>
file  otherwise the change is limited to the terminal window in 
which you typed it.</p>

<p>Typing <code>printenv</code> will give you a full list of environment
variables: those you specified in your <code>.cshrc</code> file, plus those
that the operating system sets automatically.  You will see
<code>$PATH</code>, discussed above, the environment variable
<code>$PRINTER</code>, which specified your preferred printer,
<code>$DISPLAY</code>, which says where graphics are to appear, and much 
else.</p>

<p>Note the <code>alias</code> commands in <code>.cshrc</code>, which 
define personal keyboard shortcuts.  For example if you routinely type
</p><pre class="screen">   ssh joe.physics.usyd.edu.au
</pre>
<p>to access the computer '<code>joe</code>' then you can add
</p><pre class="screen">   alias ssh-joe 'ssh joe.physics.usyd.edu.au'
</pre>
<p>to your <code>.cshrc</code> and then access <code>joe</code> just by typing
<code>ssh-joe</code>.</p>


<!-- ================================================================== -->
<h2><a name="shell">Shell programming</a></h2>
<p>Once you are comfortable with Unix/Linux commands, you can considering
even more interesting operations.</p>

<p>Consider the hypothetical problem of separating a collection of
serially-numbered files with names like <code>mr2366.dcm</code>,
<code>mr2367.dcm</code>, <code>mr2368.dcm</code>, .  You want to copy
just the <em>odd</em>-numbered slices to a neighbouring directory named
<code>Odd</code>, while also renaming the copied files to 
<code>mrOdd2367.dcm</code>, <code>mrOdd2369.dcm</code>, .  If there 
were just three or four files needing to be moved, then you could issue a 
series of explicit <code>mv</code> commands, one per file.  But for any 
more you should consider using the programming power of the shell.</p>

<p>In the above hypothetical case, the solution would be to enter the
following three lines at the shell prompt:
</p><pre class="screen">    foreach f ( *[13579].dcm )
    mv $f ../Odd/`echo $f | sed 's/mr/mrOdd/'`
    end
</pre>

<p>The first line looks for all odd-numbered slices, and for each creates
a <code>mv</code> command defined by the second line.  As a result, a
series of commands, like those that you could have typed manually, is
executed automatically:
</p><pre class="screen">    mv mr2367.dcm ../Odd/mrOdd2367.dcm
    mv mr2369.dcm ../Odd/mrOdd2369.dcm
    :
</pre>

<p>Shell programming is undoubtedly an advanced topic.  However it is
often the perfect solution to a problem.  Long or frequently-used sets
of commands can be bundled into a <em>shell script</em>, and the script 
can then be run as a single command.  (You will need to <code>chmod</code>
it as well, to make it executable.)  In the above example, the 3-line
script might be named <code>extract_odd</code>, and run simply by typing
this name.  It doesn't get much easier than that.</p>

<p>Scripting can be about moving files and manipulating filenames.  It can
also be about modifying the contents of files.  <code>sort</code>,
<code>cut</code> and <code>join</code> can be used to rearrange tabular 
material very simply.  The utilities <code>sed</code> and <code>gawk</code> 
provide more powerful programmatic methods for modifying, collating, and 
extracting values in text files.  For example, if a file contains columns 
of numbers, and you want to see just the first column and the ratio of the 
next two, then
</p><pre class="screen">    gawk '{if(NF&gt;=3) print $1,$2/$3}' dat.txt
</pre>
<p>will do the job.</p>

<p>Finally, the code below is a realistic example of a shell script, whose
goal should be obvious.  To maximize its utility the script (named
<code>t2ps</code>) is placed in <code>~/bin</code>, which should be made 
part of your <code>$PATH</code>.</p>

<pre class="screen">#!/bin/tcsh
if ($#argv == 0) then
  echo -n "File(s): "
  set filelist = ($&lt;)
else
  set filelist = ($argv[*])
endif

# Strip extensions, if present
set filelist = ($filelist:gr)

# Process each file, checking first that each exists
foreach filename ( $filelist )
  if ( -e $filename.tex &amp;&amp; -f $filename.tex ) then
    latex $filename.tex &amp;&amp; dvips $filename -o &amp;&amp; rm $filename.{aux,dvi,log} 
  else
    echo "t2ps: input file $filename.tex not found"
  endif
end
</pre>

<p>Shell programming is a big topic.  Reading <code>man tcsh</code> (or 
<code>man bash</code>) is a start, but a difficult one.  I recommend books like 
<em>Linux in a Nutshell</em> and <em>Redhat Linux Toolbox</em>, which concisely 
cover all topics and provide brief examples.  Also I like and recommend the 
many freely-available reference cards: see, for example, the collection at
<a href="http://www.cheat-sheets.org/">www.cheat-sheets.org</a>.
